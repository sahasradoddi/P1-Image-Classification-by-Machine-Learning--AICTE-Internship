##Project Overview
This project showcases my work in designing and implementing a machine learning model specifically for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable, efficient, and accessible system that accurately classifies images into predefined categories. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deploying the model through a Streamlit-based interface, I aimed to create a solution that balances technical performance with ease of use for real-world applications.
##Features
CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes.
A CNN-based model, optimized for accuracy and computational efficiency.
A user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.
Seamless backend integration using Python and Streamlit APIs.
Scalable deployment through Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.
