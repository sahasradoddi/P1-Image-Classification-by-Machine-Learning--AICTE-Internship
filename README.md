#**P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning--AICTE-Internship**



##**Project Overview**

This project showcases my work in designing and implementing a machine learning model specifically for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.  By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deploying the model through a Streamlit-based interface, I aimed to create a solution that balances technical performance with ease of use for real-world applications.



##**How Execute **

Firstly create an environment on Anaconda with all the necessary libraries and packages like tensorflow ,streamlit,etc.

And once the environment is ready you may Use the Google Collab or Jupyter Notebook to run or train the Model Using the *Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification*file .

Once it is done Select your Environment in Anaconda Prompt by using Command * conda activate "env name"*.

Then Set The Path to the Respective Directory in the Local system .

Finally Run The Streamlit Application Named _"newApp.py"_  Using the Command  *"streamlit run newApp.py"* then you are redirected to the streamlit Interface.



##**Features**

CIFAR-10 dataset consisting of 60,000 labeled images across 10 classes.
A CNN-based model, optimized for accuracy and computational efficiency.
A user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.
Seamless backend integration using Python and Streamlit APIs.
Scalable deployment through Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.


##**Technologies Used**

The project incorporates some of the most advanced tools and technologies in machine learning and deployment, including:

Programming Languages: Python for model building and integration.
Frameworks: TensorFlow for deep learning and Scikit-learn for auxiliary tasks.
Frontend Tools: Streamlit for an interactive and user-centric design.
Deployment Platform: Streamlit Cloud for making the application live and accessible.




##**How It Works**

This project provides a simple yet effective workflow. The user uploads an image or selects one from the dataset using the Streamlit interface. The image is processed and classified using the trained CNN model, and the classification results are displayed instantly in an intuitive manner.

##**Results**

The model demonstrates excellent performance, achieving high accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
Its streamlined design ensures quick processing and user-friendly interaction. The deployed application is an 
excellent demonstration of how AI can be practically implemented for real-world use cases.

##**Future Enhancements**

While this project achieves its primary objectives, there is room for further enhancements, such as:

Expanding the model to classify more complex datasets or real-world data.
Optimizing the model for use on edge devices with limited computational power.
Incorporating additional features like explainability for better interpretability of predictions.
